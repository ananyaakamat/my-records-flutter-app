# JSON Extension Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated the backup service to add `.json` extension to backup files as requested.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `lib/core/services/backup_service.dart`

- **Line ~154**: Updated filename to include `.json` extension:

  ```dart
  final filename = 'my_records$formattedDate.json';
  ```

- **Line ~243**: Updated `getAvailableBackups()` to look for `.json` files:

  ```dart
  .where((entity) =>
      entity is File &&
      entity.path.endsWith('.json') &&
      path.basename(entity.path).startsWith('my_records'))
  ```

- **Line ~460**: Updated cleanup method to filter for `.json` files:
  ```dart
  .where((file) =>
      file is File &&
      file.path.endsWith('.json') &&
      path.basename(file.path).startsWith('my_records'))
  ```

#### 2. `test/backup_service_test.dart`

- Updated test cases to reflect the new `.json` extension
- Changed test file path examples to include `.json`

#### 3. `BACKUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- Updated filename format documentation
- Changed examples from `my_records28Oct25_0955AM` to `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json`

#### 4. `BACKUP_FIX.md`

- Updated expected behavior documentation
- Changed file naming convention to include `.json` extension

## New File Format

### Filename Pattern

- **Before**: `my_records28Oct25_0955AM` (no extension)
- **After**: `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json` (with .json extension)

### Benefits of .json Extension

1. **File Type Recognition**: Operating systems and apps can properly identify the file type
2. **Better Compatibility**: JSON files are universally recognized
3. **Editor Support**: Text editors will provide JSON syntax highlighting
4. **MIME Type**: Web browsers and file managers will handle the file correctly
5. **Backup Validation**: Easy to verify file content and structure

### File Location

Files are still saved in: `Android/Downloads/my_records/`

### Backward Compatibility

The app will now look for:

- Files that start with `my_records`
- Files that end with `.json`
- Both conditions must be met for a file to be recognized as a backup

## Testing

- ✅ Flutter analyze passes with no issues
- ✅ All file operations updated consistently
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect changes
- ✅ Code is ready for deployment

## Expected User Experience

1. Create a backup → File saved as `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json`
2. File appears in Available Backups list
3. Can restore, share, or delete the backup
4. File is properly recognized by other apps due to .json extension
