# Backup Frequency Implementation Summary

## Overview

Complete implementation of backup frequency functionality (daily and weekly auto backups) for My Records app, following the Health Records app architecture as requested.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto Backup Functionality**

- **Daily and Weekly Scheduling**: Users can enable automatic backups with daily or weekly frequency
- **Background Execution**: Uses WorkManager for reliable background task execution
- **Settings Persistence**: Auto backup preferences are saved using SharedPreferences

### 2. **File Location & Naming**

- **Location**: Backup files are now saved in `Android/Downloads/my_records/` folder
- **Filename Format**: `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json` (with .json extension)
  - Format: `my_records{DD}{MMM}{YY}_{HHMM}{AM/PM}.json`
  - Example: `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json` for October 28, 2025 at 09:55 AM

### 3. **Cross-App Compatibility**

- Files stored in Downloads folder are accessible to other apps
- Shared external storage location enables cross-app backup sharing
- Proper Android permissions for external storage access

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### 1. `lib/core/services/backup_service.dart`

- **WorkManager Integration**: Added background task scheduling with callbackDispatcher
- **Settings Management**: Added methods for getting/setting auto backup preferences
- **File Path Update**: Changed from app external storage to Downloads/my_records directory
- **Filename Format**: Updated to match Health Records app pattern
- **Cleanup Logic**: Added automatic cleanup of old backups (keeps latest 3)

#### 2. `lib/features/home/presentation/backup_restore_screen.dart`

- **Settings Persistence**: Load and save auto backup settings using BackupService
- **UI Updates**: Proper frequency dropdown values and toggle states
- **Real-time Updates**: Settings changes are immediately saved and applied

#### 3. `lib/main.dart`

- **Service Initialization**: Added BackupService.instance.initialize() for proper setup

### Technical Architecture

#### WorkManager Configuration

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager().executeTask((task, inputData) async {
    // Background backup execution
  });
}
```

#### Settings Management

- Auto backup enabled/disabled state
- Frequency selection (daily/weekly)
- Last backup timestamp tracking
- Persistent storage using SharedPreferences

#### File System Organization

```
/storage/emulated/0/Download/my_records/
├── my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json
├── my_records27Oct25_1430PM.json
└── my_records26Oct25_0900AM.json
```

### User Experience

#### Backup Settings Screen

- **Auto Backup Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic backups
- **Frequency Selection**: Dropdown with "Daily" and "Weekly" options
- **Settings Persistence**: Preferences are saved immediately
- **Background Operation**: No user intervention required once enabled

#### Background Operation

- **Constraints**: Only runs when device is charging and has Wi-Fi (optional)
- **Reliability**: WorkManager ensures execution even if app is closed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with debug logging

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Created comprehensive test suite in `test/backup_service_test.dart`:

- Singleton pattern verification
- Settings management testing
- Filename format validation
- Directory path testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Enable Auto Backup**: Toggle on and set frequency
2. **Verify File Location**: Check Downloads/my_records folder
3. **Filename Format**: Verify correct naming convention
4. **Background Execution**: Ensure backups run automatically
5. **Cross-App Access**: Verify files are accessible from other apps

## Benefits

### For Users

- **Automated Data Protection**: No manual backup required
- **Cross-Device Sharing**: Files in Downloads folder can be shared
- **Reliable Scheduling**: WorkManager ensures backups happen on schedule
- **Clean Filename Format**: Easy to identify backup date and time

### For Developers

- **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new backup features
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Testable Components**: Well-structured code for unit testing

## Configuration Options

### Backup Frequency

- **Daily**: Backup created every 24 hours
- **Weekly**: Backup created every 7 days

### File Management

- **Maximum Files**: Keeps latest 3 backup files
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes older backups automatically
- **Cross-App Access**: Files accessible via file managers and other apps

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

- Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Backup encryption for sensitive data
- Multiple backup location options
- Backup verification and integrity checks
- User-defined backup schedules (custom intervals)

This implementation provides a complete, reliable, and user-friendly backup system that matches the requirements and follows the Health Records app architecture patterns.
