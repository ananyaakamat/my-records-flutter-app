# Backup Files Not Showing Fix

## Issue

Backup files were being created in the `my_records` folder but were not appearing in the "Available Backups" section of the app.

## Root Cause

The `getAvailableBackups()` method in `BackupService` was looking for files with `.json` extension:

```dart
.where((entity) => entity is File && entity.path.endsWith('.json'))
```

However, the backup files are created without any file extension, following the format:

- `my_records28Oct25_0955AM` (no extension)

## Solution

Updated the `getAvailableBackups()` method to detect backup files based on the filename pattern instead of file extension:

```dart
.where((entity) =>
    entity is File &&
    path.basename(entity.path).startsWith('my_records'))
```

## Changes Made

### File: `lib/core/services/backup_service.dart`

- **Line ~240**: Modified the file filtering logic in `getAvailableBackups()`
- **Added**: Better error handling with debug logging
- **Result**: Now detects all backup files that start with 'my_records' regardless of extension

## Testing

- ✅ Flutter analyze passes without issues
- ✅ App builds and installs successfully
- ✅ Backup files should now appear in the Available Backups list

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:

1. Create a backup using the "Create Backup" button
2. The backup file will be saved as `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json` (with .json extension)
3. The file will now appear in the "Available Backups" section
4. You can restore, share, or delete the backup from the UI

## File Naming Convention

Backup files now use the format with .json extension:

- **Pattern**: `my_records{DD}{MMM}{YY}_{HHMM}{AM/PM}.json`
- **Example**: `my_records28Oct25_0955AM.json`
- **Location**: `Android/Downloads/my_records/`
- **Extension**: .json (for better file type recognition)

This fix ensures that backup files created with the custom naming format are properly detected and displayed in the app's backup management interface.
